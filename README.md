# CONSTRUCT-3-test_game

Greetings, this is a modest, incomplete 2D game that I developed as part of my efforts to learn the fundamentals of Construct 3.

## Contents include

- A primary character `Luffy` features both static and dynamic animations.
- He has the ability to gather `Devil Fruits` to enhance the quantity of his unique punches.
- He possesses three hearts, which he forfeits if he falls off the map, or loses one heart upon encountering the "spikes."
- The map features a platform for movement, along with various small obstacles.
